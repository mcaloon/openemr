Steps to install the ICD 9 database:
<ol>
<li>The raw data feed release can be obtained from <b><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/codes.html">this CMS location</a></b>
<li>Place the downloaded ICD 9 database zip file into the contrib/icd9 directory.</li><li>openEMR manages the validity of the coding tables by carefully tracking the releases and when and how you install them. Therefore each release for ICD9 requires you to make a new entry in the <b>supported_external_databases</b> table in the MySQL database. This is done by taking an MD5 checksum of this new zip file you just downloaded and adding the new row into the table.</li>
<li>Return to this page and you will be able to complete the ICD9 installation process by clicking on the ICD9 section header </li>
</ol>
